# CleanTabs - Chrome Extension

CleanTabs is a Chrome extension designed to help users manage their browser tabs and bookmarks more efficiently.

## Features

- **Bookmark Management**: The extension also provides functionalities to organize bookmarks into folders or subfolders, making them easier to find and access later.
- **Statistics**: Show statistics such as the total number of tabs, active and inactive tabs.
